Allowing trusted Microsoft services grants access to the storage account for the following services: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Networking, Azure Monitor and Azure SQL Data Warehouse (when registered in the subscription). Turning on firewall rules for a storage account will block access to incoming requests for data, including from other Azure services, such as using the portal and writing logs. Functionality can be re-enabled. The customer can get access to services like Monitor, Networking, Hubs, and Event Grid by enabling Trusted Microsoft Services through exceptions.

If the interactive serial console on an instance is enabled, clients can attempt to connect to that instance from any IP address. For security purposes interactive serial console support should be disabled. A virtual machine instance has four virtual serial ports. Interacting with a serial port is similar to using a terminal window: input and output is entirely in text mode with no graphical interface or mouse support.

The interactive serial console does not support IP-based access restrictions, for example, an IP whitelist. If you enable the interactive serial console on an instance, clients can connect to that instance from any IP address.

Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity on your Compute Engine VM instances, so you can be confident your instances have not been compromised by boot- or kernel-level malware or rootkits. The verifiable integrity of a Shielded VM is achieved through the use of Secure Boot and integrity monitoring, see below for further details. We recommend you launch Compute instances with Shielded VM enabled to defend against advanced threats, and ensure that the boot loader and firmware on your VMs are signed and untampered. Shielded VM instances run firmware signed and verified using Google's Certificate Authority, ensuring the instance's firmware is unmodified and the root of trust for Secure Boot is established. Secure Boot is a virtual trusted platform module (vTPM)-enabled Measured Boot. It helps ensure that the system only runs authentic software by verifying the digital signature of all boot components and halting the boot process if signature verification fails. Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the state of your VM instances.

When Flow Logs are enabled for a subnet, VMs within that subnet report on all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows. Each VM samples the inbound and outbound TCP and UDP flows it sees, whether the flow is to or from another VM, a host in the on-premises datacenter, a Google service, or a host on the Internet. If two GCP VMs are communicating and both are in subnets that have VPC Flow Logs enabled, both VMs report the flows. We recommended you set Flow Logs to On to capture this data.

Central ID management provides a single place to manage database users and simplifies permission management. - It provides an alternative to SQL Server authentication. - Helps stop the proliferation of user identities across database servers. - Allows password rotation in a single place. - Customers can manage database permissions using external (AAD) groups. - It can eliminate storing passwords by enabling integrated Windows authentication and other forms of authentication supported by Azure Active Directory. - Azure AD authentication uses contained database users to authenticate identities at the database level. - Azure AD supports token-based authentication for applications connecting to SQL Database. - Azure AD authentication supports ADFS (domain federation) or native user/password authentication for a local Azure Active Directory without domain synchronization. - Azure AD supports connections from SQL Server Management Studio that use Active Directory Universal Authentication, which includes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA includes strong authentication with a range of easy verification options — phone call, text message, smart cards with pin, or mobile app notification.","sandbox-legitsecurity/terragoat","['All']","2024-01-05T13:05:23.437Z","Open","IaC","Low","sandbox-legitsecurity","None","[]","2024-01-05T13:05:23.437Z"
