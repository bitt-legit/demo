The attackers could also access and attack networked devices outside of Azure.
We recommend you disable SSH access over the internet to Network Security Groups.</td><td>test1/test1</td><td>['All', 'Azure']</td><td>2022-09-29T19:43:08.641Z</td><td>Open</td><td>IaC</td><td>Critical</td><td>legitbitt</td><td>None</td><td>[]</td><td>2022-09-29T19:43:08.641Z</td></tr>

Storage Logging takes place server-side recording details in the storage account for both successful and failed requests. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues. Storage Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests: timing information, for example start time, end-to-end latency, server latency, authentication details, concurrency information, and the size of request and response messages.
Storage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.

By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, the default action must be changed.
We recommend you configure storage accounts to deny access to traffic from all networks, including internet traffic. At an appropriate time, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure Virtual networks, allowing a secure network boundary for specific applications to be built. Access can also be granted to public internet IP address ranges enabling connections from specific internet or on-premises clients. When network rules are configured only applications from allowed networks can access a storage account. When calling from an allowed network applications continue to require authorization, such as a valid access key or SAS token, to access the storage account.</td><td>test1/test1</td><td>['All', 'Azure']</td><td>2022-09-29T19:43:08.64Z</td><td>Resolved</td><td>IaC</td><td>Medium</td><td>legitbitt</td><td>None</td><td>[]</td><td>2023-01-18T20:21:06.209Z</td></tr>

1 - s3:PutBucketPolicy, s3:PutBucketAcl, and s3:PutObjectAcl grant permissions to modify the properties of S3 buckets or objects for new or existing objects in an S3 bucket, which could expose objects to rogue actors or to the internet.
2 - ecr:SetRepositoryPolicy could allow an attacker to exfiltrate container images (which sometimes unintentionally contain secrets and non-public information), tamper with container images, or otherwise modify.
3 - iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy could allow an attacker to create a backdoor by assuming a privileged role in the victim account from an external account.
The ability to modify AWS Resource Access Manager, which could allow a malicious actor to share a VPC hosting sensitive or internal services to rogue AWS accounts
Attackers can easily exploit Resource Exposure permissions to expose resources to rogue users or the internet, as shown by endgame, an AWS pentesting tool that was also released by Salesforce.

Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism to connect to Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, identities of database users and other Microsoft services can be managed in one central location. Central ID management provides a single place to manage database users and simplifies permission management.
- It provides an alternative to SQL Server authentication.
- Helps stop the proliferation of user identities across database servers.
- Allows password rotation in a single place.
- Customers can manage database permissions using external (AAD) groups.
- It can eliminate storing passwords by enabling integrated Windows authentication and other forms of authentication supported by Azure Active Directory.
- Azure AD authentication uses contained database users to authenticate identities at the database level.
- Azure AD supports token-based authentication for applications connecting to SQL Database.
- Azure AD authentication supports ADFS (domain federation) or native user/password authentication for a local Azure Active Directory without domain synchronization.
- Azure AD supports connections from SQL Server Management Studio that use Active Directory Universal Authentication, which includes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA includes strong authentication with a range of easy verification options — phone call, text message, smart cards with pin, or mobile app notification.</td><td>sandbox-legitsecurity/terragoat</td><td>['All']</td><td>2024-01-05T13:05:23.437Z</td><td>Open</td><td>IaC</td><td>Low</td><td>sandbox-legitsecurity</td><td>None</td><td>[]</td><td>2024-01-05T13:05:23.437Z</td></tr>
